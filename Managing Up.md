# Managing Up: What It Actually Means (And Why Visibility Matters More Than You Think)

Let's clear something up: "managing up" isn't what most people think it is. It's not about doing your boss's job or stepping into their shoes. But here's the thing: what most people *think* managing up means is actually one of the most important career strategies you can deploy.

So let's break down both concepts, because you need to master them both to get promoted.

## What Managing Up Actually Is

The real definition of managing up is simpler than you'd expect: it's about building a strong, productive working relationship with your manager so both of you can do your best work.

This means understanding how your manager prefers to communicate. Do they want quick Slack updates or detailed emails? Impromptu conversations or scheduled 1:1s? Figure that out and adapt.

Anticipate their questions. Have answers ready before they ask. Flag potential problems before they become your manager's problems. Bring solutions, not just complaints. Make their job easier through better collaboration and proactive communication.

Think of it as a partnership. Your manager has limited time and attention. They're juggling multiple direct reports, their own deliverables, and shielding your team from organizational chaos. When you manage up effectively, you reduce their cognitive load and build the trust that makes them your advocate.

**But here's what managing up won't do by itself: get you promoted.**

## The Missing Piece: Being Visible

Great work in a vacuum doesn't get you promoted. Neither does being the perfect team player who anticipates their manager's every need. You know what does? Being impossible to ignore.

Promotions don't happen just because you're doing great work at your current level. They happen because you've demonstrated you're already operating at the next level, and the right people have seen it.

This is where you need to get strategic about your career. Here's what that looks like:

**Take on work above your pay grade.** Don't just contribute to projects. Lead initiatives that would typically land on your manager's plate. Run point on strategic work. Build executive presentations. Stand in for your boss in critical meetings.

**Make yourself visible to decision-makers.** Your manager matters, but they're not the only one. Get in rooms where decisions are made. Build relationships across the organization. Let senior leadership see your capabilities firsthand.

**Claim ownership proactively.** Don't wait to be asked. Tell your manager you're taking on a project in their stead. Volunteer for the difficult, high-visibility work that others avoid. Show initiative before someone has to delegate to you.

**Communicate your impact.** Keep track of your wins and make sure they're visible. This isn't bragging. It's making sure decision-makers understand the value you're creating.

## How These Work Together

Here's the reality: you need both.

Managing up (the real kind) builds the foundation. It creates trust with your manager and ensures you're aligned on priorities. When promotion discussions happen, your manager becomes your advocate, but only if you've built that relationship.

Being visible and operating at the next level is what actually gets you the promotion. It's proving you can handle bigger responsibilities. It's being known to the people who make decisions. It's demonstrating leadership before you have the title.

The combination is powerful. Manage up to build your manager's support, then step up strategically to show everyone else you're ready.

## What This Means For You

Don't confuse doing great work with career advancement. And don't assume managing your manager's expectations alone will get you promoted.

You need to master the relationship (true managing up) while simultaneously building your visibility and demonstrating next-level capability. One makes you a great employee. The other makes you promotable.

Most people only do one or the other. The people who get promoted do both.
